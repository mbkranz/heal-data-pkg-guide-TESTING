## Different annotation approaches

After you determine your data sharing orientation, you must determine how you will annotate your data. Specifically, you must determine whether you want to annotate all files included in your study, regardless of whether they will shared (wholistic annotation), or whether you will annotate only those files that are necessary to reproduce your results or dataset of interest (minimal annotation). Whether you annotate 'as you go' or retrospectively ('top-down') will largely be dictated by where you are in your study when you start to think about data sharing and annotation.

There are three main ways to annotate:

**Wholistic, As you go annotation:** Annotating all study files as they are created, regardless of whether they will be shared

**Wholistic, Top-down annotation:** Starting with your result or dataset of interest and working backwards, annotating all study files necessary to reproduce the result, regardless of whether they will shared

**Minimal, Top down annotation**: Starting with your result or dataset of interest and working backwards, annotating only study files necessary to reproduce the result that will be shared
