# Introduction

This document describes how to create a HEAL-compliant *data package*. A data
package is a portable archive containining research data together with the
metadata, supporting files and documentation needed to permit someone to
(re)use the data for a specific purpose.

The focus here is on creating data packages suitable for submission to a
public data repository to permit replication of a previous analysis and/or
secondary analyses. Such packages include the information necessary to make
the data *findable*, *accessible*, *interoperable* and *reusable*
([FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)). In other words, they
include metadata that may be indexed and searched to permit researchers to
find the data, organize and store files using common, open standards and
formats that make the data easy to use, and include sufficient information on
provenance and data use requirements and restrictions to permit researchers to
reuse the data.
