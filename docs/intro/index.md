# Introduction
This document walks through the process for developing and assembling a HEAL-compliant "data package" for submission to a public data repository. 

## What is a "data package"? 

In addition to the data itself, it is important for investigators to provide understandable supporting information that provides consistent context, including an inventory of data and output files and accompanying annotation about what each file contains, how it was produced, its relationship with other files and with published results, and how it can be accessed and used. 

These supporting files are important for **potential secondary data users** as they: 

* allow potential secondary data users to understand enough about the study and data to determine whether the study/data may be of use for their purposes, and whether it makes sense for them to reach out to request access to the data or to propose a collaboration
* facilitate use of the data by requesting researchers 

Importantly, this type of documentation and data 'packaging' can be incredibly valuable to the **originating study group** - it can:

* ease submission of shareable data and necessary supporting files to a public data repository as required by journals and/or funding agencies
* stimulate collaboration with other research groups, and re-use of data (which may lead to additional citations of the originating study/data)
* facilitate retention of institutional knowledge, on-boarding of new research staff to an existing project, as well as replication and extension of study results within the originating study group
