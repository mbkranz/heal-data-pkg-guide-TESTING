# Introduction
This document walks through the process for developing and assembling a HEAL-compliant "data package". The primary purpose of assembling a "data package" is to facilitate submission of shareable data and non-data supporting files to a public data repository in a manner that allows potential secondary data users to determine whether the data may be useful for their secondary analysis purposes, and to actually understand and use the data for their secondary analysis purposes.
