# Introduction
This document walks through the process for developing and assembling a HEAL-compliant "data package". The primary purpose of assembling a "data package" is to facilitate submission of shareable data and non-data supporting files to a public data repository in a manner that allows potential secondary data users to determine whether the data may be useful for their secondary analysis purposes, and to actually understand and use the data for their secondary analysis purposes. 

## What is a "data package"? 

Aside from the data itself, it is important for investigators to provide context and usability information, including: what questions was the study group trying to answer in collecting the data, how did they design study experiment(s)/activity(s) to answer those questions, how was data collected, what data was collected, what is in each data file, how to use it, how it relates to other data files, how it relates to published results, etc. 

In fact, supporting or metadata files that include this context and usability information are arguably as or more important than the data itself. Without the context information, it is difficult for potential secondary data users or collaborators to get even a high-level sense of whether it may be productive to request access to study data or to reach out regarding a collaboration with the originating study group. Without the usability information, it is difficult for potential secondary data users or collaborators to get a more granular view of whether the collected data may be usable for their secondary data use purposes, and it may be difficult or impossible to actually use the data for their secondary data use purposed. 

Some of this context and usability information is about the study as a whole, and provided at the "study-level" (e.g. what questions was the study group trying to answer, how did they design study experiment(s)/activity(s) to answer those questions), and some is about a specific data file, and provided at the "file-level" (e.g. what variables are in a tabular data file, how these variables were calculated, how these variables relate to validated data collection instruments, etc.).

Essential "study-level" supporting or metadata files included in a "data package": 

* **Experiment Tracker**: an inventory of experiments or activities included in the study; for a clinical trial, this may be simply one experiment equal to the registered clinical trial activity; for a basic biology study, this may be a listing of several orthogonal experiments used altogether to address and advance the study aims, 
* **Resource Tracker**: an inventory of data and non-data supporting files produced during the course of the study, including file relationships and dependencies, and whether/how each file is shareable in a public repository or not  

Essential "file-level" supporting or metadata files included in a "data package": 

* **Data Dictionary**: an inventory of variables included in a tabular data file, 
* **Results Tracker**: an inventory of figure, table, or text results included in a multi-result file (e.g. a publication) 

## What is the purpose of a "data package"? 

These supporting or metadata files are important for **potential secondary data users** as they: 

* allow potential secondary data users to understand enough about the study and data to determine whether the study/data may be of use for their purposes, and whether it makes sense for them to reach out to request access to the data or to propose a collaboration with the originating study group
* facilitate use of the data by requesting researchers 

Importantly, this type of documentation and data 'packaging' can be incredibly valuable to the **originating study group** - it can:

* ease submission of shareable data and necessary supporting files to a public data repository as required by journals and/or funding agencies
* stimulate collaboration with other research groups, and re-use of data (which may lead to additional citations of the originating study/data)
* facilitate retention of institutional knowledge, on-boarding of new research staff to an existing project, as well as replication and extension of study results within the originating study group
