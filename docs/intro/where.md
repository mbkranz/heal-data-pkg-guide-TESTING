# Where should you create a data package?

Create your data package locally, wherever you store the data and non-data supporting files collected or produced by or for your study 

* Do not move or replicate any files to accommodate the data packaging process
* Creating your "data package" amounts to creating and completing **Standard data package metadata files** for your study to add context and usability info about your existing data and non-data supporting files 
* Creating your data package by creating and completing **Standard data package metadata files** for your study will allow creation of a "shareable" version of your data package that: 
    * includes only files that have been specified as shareable to a public repository, and 
    * is organized in a manner that facilitates submission to a public repository and human interpretability of the submitted file structure     

This "shareable" version of your data package will also be created locally, and may subsequently be submitted to a public data repository by study staff.
