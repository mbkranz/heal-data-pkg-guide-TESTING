# Why should you create a data package?  


## Potential Secondary Data Users

Creating and completing a data package (including creation and completion of all [standard data package metadata files](../terms/index.md#standard-data-package-metadata-files)) are important for **potential secondary data users** as they: 

* allow potential secondary data users to understand enough about the study and data to determine whether the study/data may be of use for their purposes, and whether it makes sense for them to reach out to request access to the data or to propose a collaboration with the originating study group
* facilitate use of the data by requesting researchers

## Originating Study Group

Importantly, this type of documentation and data 'packaging' can be incredibly valuable to the **originating study group** - it can:

* ease submission of shareable data and necessary supporting files to a public data repository as required by journals and/or funding agencies
* stimulate collaboration with other research groups, and re-use of data (which may lead to additional citations of the originating study/data)
* facilitate retention of institutional knowledge, on-boarding of new research staff to an existing project, as well as replication and extension of study results within the originating study group
