# What is your data sharing orientation?

Determining what your goals are for data sharing will help guide you in determining what you will include in your future data package and how you will annotate the data and non-data supporting files/resources in your data package.

People will have different goals in sharing data and non-data supporting files/resources from their study. These goals, or 'orientations' may be dictated by a number of factors such as the nature of the data, study staff resources and time constraints, and investigator preference.

There are two main data sharing "orientations."

# Data sharing "orientations"
* Results-support
* Dataset-sharing

**These data sharing goals or "orientations" are not mutually exclusive**. You may choose both Results-support and Dataset-sharing as goals for your study's data sharing approach. See more about each data sharing orientation below, and decide if one, or both, apply to your study.

<details>

<summary>Results-support</summary>
    
Select this data sharing orientation if you are primarily interested in sharing the data that supports results you have or will publish in a manuscript(s). 

<br> <br>
        <b>Example</b><br>
        
        You are early on in your study, just starting to collect data and perform some initial analysis. Your data processing steps are complex and reasonable people might take a different approach at any particular data processing stage (e.g. different filtering threshold, different normalization procedure, different software implementation of an algorithm or modeling approach). You know that you would like to make sure that readers of the manuscript you will eventually publish can replicate your pre-proccessing steps and potentially access the raw data and pre-processing code/instructions/protocol so that they may modify one or more of the pre-processing steps and examine how that changes results published in your manuscript, and/or so that they may more easily compare the results from your study to results from their own studies (in which they use a slightly different pre-processing approach). 
         

<br> <br>
        <b>Example</b><br>
        
        Your study is complete, and you have very limited time or resources budgeted for data sharing. You have published a manuscript on your results or are in the process of submitting one. You want to fulfill the minimum data sharing requirements, so you will only share the data required to reproduce the manuscript results.

<summary> Dataset-oriented</summary>
    
    Select this data sharing orientation if you are primarily interested in sharing a specific set of data or as much data as possible so that other researchers can get additional value from them, such as conducting additional research and analyes beyond the original study's focus.
    <br> <br>
        <b>Example</b><br>
       Your study is collecting RNA expression data. You are only focusing on a small subset of the collected data for your study, but you would like to be able to share as much of this data as possible so that other investigators can comb through the rich data for other analyses and insight.
