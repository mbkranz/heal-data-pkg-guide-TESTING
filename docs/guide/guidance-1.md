# Guidance for study stage: early  

In general, an overview of the data packaging process looks like: 

1. Audit relevant files
2. Organize and consistently name your files and folders - using HEAL recommendations for organizing and naming study files/resources
3. Add Standard data package metadata - File-level
4. Add Standard data package metadata - Study-level

Please see below for detailed guidance on how and when to create and complete your data package if your study stage is **early** 

## Audit relevant files 
**Start now - complete right away** - Audit all files that have so far been created/produced by or for the study. 

## Organize and consistently name your files and folders 
**Start now - complete right away** - Once you've audited all of your study files/resources, consider following [HEAL recommendations for file naming and organization](../terms/name.md). In order to do this, you may need to change the location of and/or rename existing study files.  

* Establish file organization and naming conventions for all existing files, and follow these established conventions as you continue to move forward in your study and create/save new study files using these file organization and naming conventions. 
* This may make it easier for other people (and your future self!) to intuitively understand and interpret the study organization and meaning and utility of various study files. It may also make data packaging (especially completion of your data package's Resource Tracker) easier for study staff.
* **NOTE**: Do not copy or duplicate files to implement. 

## Add Standard data package metadata (File-level) 
Currently, file-level standard data package metadata files are the data dictionary (heal-formatted-data-dictionary; one per tabular data file) and the results tracker (heal-formatted-results-tracker; one per multi-result file - e.g. manuscript, poster).

**Data Dictionary**: 

* **Start now - complete right away** - Determine if your study has produced any tabular data files. If yes, go ahead and create a data dictionary for each of your existing tabular datasets. Please see here [add link to cli tools and/or desktop tool approach] for instructions on how to create (or at least get a head start on creating) a HEAL formatted data dictionary using just your tabular data file as input.

* **Start now - complete over the course of your study** - Create a data dictionary for each of your tabular datasets as the dataset is created. Please see here [add link to cli tools and/or desktop tool approach] for instructions on how to create (or at least get a head start on creating) a HEAL formatted data dictionary using just your tabular data file as input.   

* **NOTE**: If your study has not and will not produce any tabular data files, you will not create a data dictionary 

**Results Tracker**:  

* **Wait until your study is starting to formulate final results text, tables, or figures - complete over the remainder of your study and manuscript production process**  

    * Create a result annotation file for each of your final results (i.e. text, tables, or figures) as the final result is formulated and fleshed out into a text, table, or figure. Please see here [add link to cli tools and/or desktop tool approach] for instructions on how to create a result annotation file and how to use these files to create a distinct results tracker for each final multi-result file produced/shared/published by your study. 
* **NOTE**: If your study's data sharing orientation or goal is focused on dataset-sharing (i.e. sharing a dataset of general interest to the scientific/research community), and less focused on results-support (i.e. providing clear support for results you share in a manuscript), you may not need to create a results tracker.

## Add Standard data package metadata (Study-level) - when, and how
Currently, study-level standard data package metadata files are the experiment tracker (heal-formatted-experiment-tracker; one per study) and the resource tracker (heal-formatted-resource-tracker; one per study).

**Experiment Tracker**: Each study should create and complete an experiment tracker; it is meant to be an inventory of each component experiment or activity that is part of your study. It is expected that some studies (e.g. clinical trials) may have just a single component study experiment/activity, whereas others may have many (e.g. many basic science studies). If you are early on in your study and all component study experiments/activities are already known/designed, go ahead and complete the experiment tracker right away. If you are early on in your study and all component study experiments/activities are NOT already known/designed, you may want to consider starting your experiment tracker right away, adding the experiments/activities that are already known/designed, and then moving forward add each new experiment/activity as it is designed ("as you go" annotation). If you are later on in your study, you may want to consider using your experiment tracker to inventory a specific subset of study experiments/activities instead of all study experiments/activities; specifically, you may want to wait until you are at the study stage of producing the result(s) and/or dataset(s) your study group aims to share before starting your experiment tracker; this will allow you to pick and choose, adding only the experiments/activities that produced items that support the result(s) or dataset(s) you will share.   

**Resource Tracker**: Each study should create and complete a resource tracker; it is meant to be an inventory of each data or non-data supporting file collected/produced by or for the study, plus all standard data package metadata files added during the data packaging process. If you are early on in your study, you may want to consider starting your resource tracker right away, adding the study files/resources that have already been created, and then moving forward, adding each new study file/resource as it is created ("as you go" annotation). If you are later on in your study, you may want to wait until you are at the study stage of producing the result(s) and/or dataset(s) your study group aims to share before starting your resource tracker; this will allow you to pick and choose, adding only the study resources/files that that support the result(s) or dataset(s) you will share.
