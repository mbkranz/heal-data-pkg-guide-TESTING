# How far along are you in your study?

Where you are in your study when you start to think about data sharing will affect how you document your data. For example, if you are near the beginning of your study, you may be able to create your data package and set up documentation processes such that you document as you move through your study, which will lead to more complete documentation and ease the process of data sharing in the future, as opposed to completing all documentation at the end. If you are nearer the end of your study, we recommend you take a narrower, more goal-oriented approach to documentation to minimize data sharing burden on your study group, while maximizing value to potential secondary data users and collaboraters. 

There are two options available for study stage.

# Study stages
* Early
* Late

These study stage options are greatly simplified. For now, **select the study stage that most closely fits with the stage you are at in your study**.

!!! note "Do you know your data sharing orientation?"
    It's a good idea to determine your data sharing orientation before proceeding. If you havent' yet, [head here](data-sharing-orientation.md) to determine your data sharing orientation, then head back here to proceed.

If you are **early** in your study and have collected or produced little data or non-data supporting files/resources, [click here](guidance-1.md).

If you are **later** in your study and have collected or produced a large amount of data and on-data supporting files/resources, [click here](late.md).
