### If your data sharing orientation is dataset-oriented...
If you are interested in sharing a specific dataset and documenting the necessary pieces to reproduce that dataset, recommended steps include:

1. Wait until shareable dataset(s) are produced
2. Annotate shareable dataset(s) in the resource tracker
3. Annotate dependencies of shareable dataset(s) (e.g., data dictionary, protocol, raw data, code)
4. Annotate dependencies of those dependencies, continuing with this cycle until final dependencies you annotate have no dependencies of their own

!!! note "The way you annotate dependencies will vary based on your annotation approach:"

    * **Wholistic**: List dependencies 'one-layer-deep', regardless of whether those dependencies will be shared; annotate all dependencies regardless of whether they will be shared.
    
    * **Minimal**: List dependencies 'liberally', regardless of whether those dependencies will be shared; annotate only dependencies that will be shared.


### If your data sharing orientation is results-support...
If you are interested in sharing data and support files that support a specific result, recommended steps include:

1. Wait until the multi-result file(s) are produced
2. Annotate multi-result file(s)
3. Create a results tracker for each multi-result file. Within the results tracker, list each result and its dependencies (e.g., data, data dictionary, code, statistical analysis plan)
4. Annotate results tracker(s)
5. Annotate dependencies of results as listed in the results tracker(s)
6. Annotate dependencies of those dependencies, continuing with this cycle until final dependencies you annotate have no dependencies of their own
7. Document the results tracker(s) as an entry into the resource tracker

!!! note "The way you annotate dependencies will vary based on your annotation approach:"

    * **Wholistic**: List dependencies 'one-layer-deep', regardless of whether those dependencies will be shared; annotate all dependencies regardless of whether they will be shared.
    
    * **Minimal**: List dependencies 'liberally', regardless of whether those dependencies will be shared; annotate only dependencies that will be shared.
