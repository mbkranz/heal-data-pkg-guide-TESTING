# If you are EARLY in your study

!!! info "Use Wholistic As-You-Go Annotation"


* Consider implementing [HEAL recommendations for organization and naming of study artefacts](docs\terms\name.md) (Note: Do not copy/duplicate files to implement)

* Consider annotating all study files as they are created, starting right away (['as you go' annotation](docs\terms\addtop.md)), regardless of whether they will be shared (['wholistic' annotation](link)) of study artefacts to reduce annotation burden at the end of the study

Recommendations differ depending on your data-sharing orientation:

=== "Dataset-oriented"

    * Annotate up to and including your shareable dataset

=== "Results-support"

    * Annotate up to and including your published/shared multi-result file(s)
    * Include and annotate a results-tracker for each multi-result file
