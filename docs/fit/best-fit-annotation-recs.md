    Study stage == early >> as you go annotation

    Data sharing orientation == results-support >> start annotating as you go; when you start to create final result products for a manuscript, start creating result annotation files and a results tracker; when manuscript is finalized, finalize result annotation files and results tracker, annotate manuscript and results tracker, check that all final result product dependencies listed in results tracker are also annotated and if not, annotate any missing dependencies
