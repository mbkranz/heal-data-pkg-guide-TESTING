    Use an ["As-you-go"](../terms/index.md#as-you-go-annotation) annotation approach; a **detailed overview** of what this involves can be found [here](../terms/index.md#as-you-go-annotation); a **brief overview** of what this involves follows below:

    <font size="3"> What to do **right away**</font>
    
    * Start annotating "As-you-go" as soon as possible
    * Audit all [study files/resources](../terms/index.md#study-filesresources) already produced by or for your study
        * Consider applying [HEAL recommendations for file organization and naming](../file-o-and-n/index.md) to these files now, and to future files as they are created
        * Create a [data dictionary](../terms/index.md#data-dictionary) for each existing [tabular data file](../terms/index.md#tabular-data-file), and create a data dictionary for any future tabular data files as they are created
    * Start your [Resource Tracker](../terms/index.md#resource-tracker)
        * Add all files already produced by/for your study to your Resource Tracker 
        * As more files are produced by/for your study add them to your Resource Tracker as soon as possible
        * The Resource Tracker will ask you to list [associated files/dependencies](../terms/index.md#associated-filesdependencies) for each study file/resource (i.e. files that are required to interpret, replicate, or use the study file/resource)
    * Start your [Experiment Tracker](../terms/index.md#experiment-tracker) 
        * Add all experiments or other study activities which have already been designed to your Experiment Tracker 
        * As more experiments or other study activities are designed add them to your Experiment Tracker as soon as possible

    <font size="3"> What to do **continuously, as-you-go**</font>
        
    * **As you create/collect new study files:** 
        * Consider applying [HEAL recommendations for file organization and naming](../file-o-and-n/index.md) to study files/resources as they are created
            * If you came up with file organization and naming conventions based on HEAL recommendations at the start of or earlier in your study, continue to consistently apply those conventions as you create/collect new study files
        * Add new study files/resources to your [Resource Tracker](../terms/index.md#resource-tracker) as they are created/collected (as soon as possible)
    * **As you create/collect new tabular data files:**
        * Create a [data dictionary](../terms/index.md#data-dictionary) for tabular data files as they are created
    * **As you design new study experiments/activities:**
        * Add new study experiments/activities to your [Experiment Tracker](../terms/index.md#experiment-tracker) as they are designed (as soon as possible)

    <font size="3"> What to do **when you start to create [final result products](../terms/index.md#final-result-products)** </font>

    * Start your [Results Tracker(s)](../terms/index.md#results-tracker) 
        * Start to create a Results Tracker to document the final result products (e.g. figures, tables) that will, or may, be published as part of a [multi-result file](../terms/index.md#multi-result-file) (e.g. report or manuscript)
        * Add all final result products already produced by/for your study to a Results Tracker 
        * As more final result products are produced by/for your study add them to a Results Tracker as soon as possible
        * The Results Tracker will ask you to list [associated files/dependencies](../terms/index.md#associated-filesdependencies) for each final result product (i.e. files that are required to interpret, replicate, or use the result) 

    <font size="3"> What to do **when your manuscript is finalized** </font>

    * Finalize the Results Tracker for the completed manuscript (or other [multi-result file](../terms/index.md#multi-result-file))
    * Add your manuscript and [associated Results Tracker](../terms/index.md#associated-results-tracker) to your Resource Tracker 
    * Check that all final result product [associated files/dependencies](../terms/index.md#associated-filesdependencies) (listed in the associated files/dependencies fields for each final result product listed in the Results Tracker) are also listed as study resource/files in your Resource Tracker - Add any that are missing
