    Use an ["As-you-go"](../terms/index.md#as-you-go-annotation) annotation approach; a **detailed overview** of what this involves can be found [here](../terms/index.md#as-you-go-annotation); a **brief overview** of what this involves follows below:

    <font size="3"> What to do **right away**</font>
    
    * Start annotating "As-you-go" as soon as possible
    * Audit all [study files/resources](../terms/index.md#study-filesresources) already produced by or for your study
        * Consider applying [HEAL recommendations for file organization and naming](../file-o-and-n/index.md) to these files now, and to future files as they are created
        * Create a [data dictionary](../terms/index.md#data-dictionary) for each existing [tabular data file](../terms/index.md#tabular-data-file), and create a data dictionary for any future tabular data files as they are created
    * Start your [resource tracker](../terms/index.md#resource-tracker)
        * Add all files already produced by/for your study to your resource tracker; 
        * As more files are produced by/for your study add them to your resource tracker as soon as possible
        * The resource tracker will ask you to list the study files that each study file/resource depends upon (i.e. files that are required to interpret, replicate, or use the study file/resource)
    * Start your [experiment tracker](../terms/index.md#experiment-tracker) 
        * Add all experiments or other study activities which have already been designed to your experiment tracker; 
        * As more experiments or other study activities are designed add them to your experiment tracker as soon as possible

    <font size="3"> What to do **when you start to create [final result products](../terms/index.md#final-result-products)** for a manuscript </font>

    * Start to create a [results tracker](../terms/index.md#results-tracker) for the manuscript to document the final result products (e.g. figures, tables) that will, or may, be published as part of the manuscript
    * The results tracker will ask you to list the study files that each final result product in the manuscript depends upon (i.e. files that are required to interpret, replicate, or use the result) 

    <font size="3"> What to do **when your manuscript is finalized** </font>

    * Finalize the results tracker for the completed manuscript
    * Add your manuscript and [associated results tracker](../terms/index.md#associated-results-tracker) to your resource tracker 
    * Check that all final result product dependencies listed in your results tracker are also listed as study resource/files in your resource tracker and if not, add any that are missing
