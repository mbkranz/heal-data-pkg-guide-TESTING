# EARLY in study

[Use Wholistic As-You-Go Annotation](../annot/introholmin.md#wholistic-annotation-of-study-artefacts){ .md-button}

* Consider implementing [HEAL recommendations for organization and naming of study artefacts](docs\terms\name.md) (Note: Do not copy/duplicate files to implement)

* Consider annotating all study files as they are created, starting right away (['as you go' annotation](docs\terms\addtop.md)), regardless of whether they will be shared (['wholistic' annotation](link)) of study artefacts to reduce annotation burden at the end of the study

**Recommendations differ depending on your data-sharing orientation:**

=== "Dataset-oriented"

    * Annotate up to and including your shareable dataset

=== "Results-support"

    * Annotate up to and including your published manuscript or shared report
    * Include and annotate a results-tracker for each manuscript or report
