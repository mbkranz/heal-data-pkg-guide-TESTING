When deciding how you will share and annotate your study data, you should consider **two key questions**.

1. What is your orientation towards data sharing?
2. How far along are you in your study?

## 1. What is your orientation towards data sharing?

Determining what your goals are for data sharing will help guide you in determining what you will include in your future data package and how you will annotate the data and non-data/supporting documents in your dat package.

People will have different goals in sharing their study data, which can be dictated by a number of factors such as the nature of the data, resources and time constraints, and investigator preference.

There are two main "data sharing orientations." They are not mutually exclusive. See more about each data sharing orientation below.

<details>
<summary> Results-support</summary>
    
    This orientation is for investigators who are interested only in fulfilling the requirement to share the data that is necessary to reproduce their results.
    <br> <br>
        <b>Example</b><br>
         Your study is complete, and you have very limited time or resources budgeted for data sharing. You have published a manuscript on your results or are in the process of submitting one. You want to fulfill the minimum data sharing requirements, so you will only share the data required to reproduce the manuscript results.

<details>
<summary> Dataset-oriented</summary>
    
    This orientation is for investigators who are interested in sharing a specific set of data or as much data as possible so that other researchers can get additional value from them, such as conducting additional research and analyes beyond the original study's focus.
    <br> <br>
        <b>Example</b><br>
       Your study is collecting RNA expression data. You are only focusing on a small subset of the collected data for your study, but you would like to be able to share as much of this data as possible so that other investigators can comb through the rich data for other analyses and insight.

## 2. How far along are you in your study?

Where you are in your study when you start to think about data sharing will affect how you document your data. For example, if you are near the beginning of your study, you may be able to set up documentation processes such that you document as you move through your study, which will ease the process of data sharing in the future, as opposed to completing all documentation at the end.

If you are early in your study and/or have collected little data and non-data/supporting elements, [click here](early.md).

If you are later in your study and/or have collected a large amount of data and non-data/supporting elements, [click here](late.md).
