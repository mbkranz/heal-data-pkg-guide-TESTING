    <ul>
    <li> Consider implementing HEAL recommendations for organization and naming of study artefacts.</li>
    <li> Consider wholistic annotation of study artefacts (annotate all study artefacts).
    <ul>
        <li> If you have not completed collecting/producing all study artefacts, consider annotating all artefacts already collected, then proceed with 'add as you' annotation of new study artefacts to reduce annotation burden at the end of the study.</li>
        <li>If you have completed collecting/producing all study artefacts, use 'top down' annotation.</li>
   </ul>
   </li>

    <ul>
    <li> Leave your original organization and naming of study artefacts in place.
    <ul>
        <li>If your study collected relatively large sets of 'like' files (e.g., a tabular file pre study subject per day with several measurements that have the same format across files) and these files do not have a consistent naming convention, we recommend implementing a consistent file name convention to increase interpretability/usability to potential secondary data users and make annotation of these files much simpler and faster</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Consider minimal annotation of study artefacts (annotate only study artefacts that will be shared) to reduce annotation burden while providing helpful context for potential secondary data users.</li>
    <li>Consider 'top down' annotation of study artefacts based on your [data sharing 'orientation'](#what-is-your-data-sharing-orientation) goal(s) to minimize annotation to a set that directly serves your data sharing goals.  </li>
