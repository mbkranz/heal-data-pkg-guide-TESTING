* Consider implementing HEAL recommendations for organization and naming of study artefacts.

* Consider wholistic annotation of study artefacts (annotate all study artefacts).

    * If you have not completed collecting/producing all study artefacts, consider annotating all artefacts already collected, then proceed with 'add as you' annotation of new study artefacts to reduce annotation burden at the end of the study.

    * If you have complete collecting/producing all study artefacts, use 'top down' annotation.
