* Consider implementing [HEAL recommendations for organization and naming of study artefacts](../../../terms/name.md).

* Consider [wholistic annotation](../../../terms/holmin.md#wholistic-annotation-of-study-artefacts) of study artefacts (annotate all study artefacts).

    * If you have not completed collecting/producing all study artefacts, consider annotating all artefacts already collected, then proceed with ['add as you' go annotation] of new study artefacts to reduce annotation burden at the end of the study.

    * If you have complete collecting/producing all study artefacts, use ['top down' annotation].
