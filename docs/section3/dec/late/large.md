* Leave your original organization and naming of study artefacts in place.
    
    !!! note "Exception"
        If your study collected relatively large sets of 'like' files (e.g., a tabular file pre study subject per day with several measurements that have the same format across files) and these files do not have a consistent naming convention, we recommend implementing a consistent file name convention to increase interpretability/usability to potential secondary data users and make annotation of these files much simpler and faster" 

* Consider minimal annotation of study artefacts (annotate only study artefacts that will be shared) to reduce annotation burden while providing helpful context for potential secondary data users.

* Consider 'top down' annotation of study artefacts based on your [data sharing 'orientation'](#what-is-your-data-sharing-orientation) goal(s) to minimize annotation to a set that directly serves your data sharing goals.
