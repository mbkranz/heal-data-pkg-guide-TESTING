# Early In Study

* Consider implementing HEAL recommendations for organization and naming of study artefacts (Note: Do not copy/duplicate files to implement)

* Consider wholistic annotation of study artefacts (annotate all study artefacts)

* Consider ['add as you go' annotation](docs\terms\addtop.md) of study artefacts to reduce annotation burden at the end of the study

If you are not interested wholistically annotating your study as you go, [click here](late/large.md).
