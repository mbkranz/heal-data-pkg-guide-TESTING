# Early In Study
Consider implementing HEAL recommendations for organization and naming of study artefacts (Note: Do not copy/duplicate files to implement)

Consider wholistic annotation of study artefacts (annotate all study artefacts)

Consider 'add as you go' annotation of study artefacts to reduce annotation burden at the end of the study

# Late In Study
Choose the response which best represents your study's situation.
[The number of total study artefacts is relatively small OR <br> Your study group is particularly interested in implementing high levels of transparency to increase understandability and continuity of data knowledge internally or externally?](#small-number-of-study-artefacts-or-interested-in-high-levels-of-transparency-in-data-sharing){ .md-button}
[The number of total study artefacts is relatively large OR <br> Your study group is more interested in implementing only mandated levels of transparency sufficient to provide context about the study and data](#large-number-of-study-artefacts-or-interested-in-implementing-mandated-levels-of-transparency){ .md-button}


## Small number of study artefacts or interested in high levels of transparency in data sharing
Consider implementing HEAL recommendations for organization and naming of study artefacts.

Consider wholistic annotation of study artefacts (annotate all study artefacts).

If you have not completed collecting/producing all study artefacts, consider annotating all artefacts already collected, then proceed with 'add as you' annotation of new study artefacts to reduce annotation burden at the end of the study.

If you have complete collecting/producing all study artefacts, use 'top down' annotation.

## Large number of study artefacts or interested in implementing mandated levels of transparency

Leave your original organization and naming of study artefacts in place.
    
!!! note "Exception"
    If your study collected relatively large sets of 'like' files (e.g., a tabular file pre study subject per day with several measurements that have the same format across files) and these files do not have a consistent naming convention, we recommend implementing a consistent file name convention to increase interpretability/usability to potential secondary data users and make annotation of these files much simpler and faster" 

Consider minimal annotation of study artefacts (annotate only study artefacts that will be shared) to reduce annotation burden while providing helpful context for potential secondary data users.

Consider 'top down' annotation of study artefacts based on your [data sharing 'orientation'](#what-is-your-data-sharing-orientation) goal(s) to minimize annotation to a set that directly serves your data sharing goals.  

# What is your data sharing 'orientation'?
Which of these best describes your orientation towards data sharing. You may be interested in more than one of these, in which case, you may want to review the recommendations for both (if they are different).
