Determining what your goals are for data sharing will help guide you in determing what you will include in your future data package and how you will annotate the data and non-data/supporting documents in your data package.

People will have different goals in sharing their study data, which can be dictated by a number of factors such as the nature of the data, resource and time constraints, and investigator preference. 

There are three main orientations. You do not have to pick just one of these orientations, although results-support is more likely to stand alone. For example, investigators may be interested in sharing a specific dataset in addition to data on their materials and methods. See more about each data sharing orientation below.

<details>
<summary> Results-support</summary>
    
    This orientation is for investigators who are interested only in fulfilling the requirement to share the data that is necessary to reproduce their results.
    <br> <br>
        <i>Example</i><br>
         Your study is complete, and you have very limited time or resources budgeted for data sharing. You have published a manuscript on your results or are in the process of submitting one. You want to fulfill the minimum data sharing requirements, so you will only share the data required to reproduce the manuscript results.

<details>
<summary> Dataset-oriented</summary>
    
    This orientation is for investigators who are interested in sharing a specific set of data or as much data as possible so that other researchers can get additional value from them, such as conducting additional research and analyes beyond the original study's focus.
    <br> <br>
        <i>Example</i><br>
       Your study is collecting RNA expression data. You are only focusing on a small subset of the collected data for your study, but you would like to be able to share as much of this data as possible so that other investigators can comb through the rich data for other analyses and insight.

<details>
<summary> Materials- and methods-oriented</summary>
    
    This orientation is for investigators who are inteersted in sharing inforamtion about their materials and methods that would allow others to reproduce or build upon them in future research.
    <br> <br>
        <i>Example</i><br>
       Your study is building an organ-on-a-chip model. You want to share information about the formulation of the chip and results demonstrating that the chip performs similarly as the organ in vivo, so that other investigators can understand the process and reassemble and build upon your successful model in future research.
