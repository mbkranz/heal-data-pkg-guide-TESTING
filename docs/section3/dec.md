<summary>Is the number of total study artefacts relatively small OR is your study group particularly interested in implementing high levels of transparency to increase understandability and continuity of data knowledge internally and externally?<summary>
    <ul>
    <li> Consider implementing HEAL recommendations for organization and naming of study artefacts.</li>
    <li> Consider wholistic annotation of study artefacts (annotate all study artefacts).</li>
    <li> If you have not completed collecting/producing all study artefacts, consider annotating all artefacts already collected, then proceed with 'add as you' annotation of new study artefacts to reduce annotation burden at the end of the study.</li>
    <li> If you have complete collecting/producing all study artefacts, use 'top down' annotation.</li>

<summary>Is the number of total study artefacts relatively large OR is your study group more interested in implementing only mandated levels of transparency sufficient to provide context about the study and data?<summary>
    <ul>
    <li> Leave your original organization and naming of study artefacts in place.</li>
    
    Exception: If your study collected relatively large sets of 'like' files (e.g., a tabular file pre study subject per day with several measurements that have the same format across files) and these files do not have a consistent naming convention, we recommend implementing a consistent file name convention to increase interpretability/usability to potential secondary data users and make annotation of these files much simpler and faster"
