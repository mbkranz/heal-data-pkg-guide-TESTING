## 'One Layer Deep' Dependencies

Annotation using 'one-layer-deep' dependencies means only documenting the immediate dependencies needed to produce/interpret/use the artefact. If you are using wholistic annotation, you will use the 'one-layer-deep' approach while documenting dependencies.

Each row/entry of the resource tracker will only have one dependency (the immediate file/document needed to create the file). The next row will list that dependency and document its dependencies, and so on, until you are annotating files with not dependencies. Given that wholistic annotation inolves documenting all files, this will allow researchers to trace the order of dependencies in a cascade to the original source files. THis will ease the ability to understand and reproduce results.

## 'Liberal' Dependencies

Annotation using ‘liberal’ dependencies means documenting all dependencies, immediate and distal, needed to produce/interpret/use each artefact. If you are using minimal annotation, you will use the ‘liberal’ approach when documenting dependencies.

Each row/entry of the resource tracker will include immediate dependencies (as in the ‘one-layer-deep’ approach) as well as the dependencies of those dependencies. Given that minimal annotation means that you are not documenting all study artefacts, this will allow researchers to understand the cascade of dependencies involved in producing each artefact, even if not all dependencies are entries in the resource tracker.
