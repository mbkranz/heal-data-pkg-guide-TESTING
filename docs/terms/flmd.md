## File-level Metadata: Results Tracker
The results tracker provides detailed information and annotation for multi-result files (e.g., manuscript, presentation). Each multi-result file will have a corresponding results tracker. The purpose of this tracker is to track and annotate each single result (e.g., a figure or textual statement) within each multiresult file as well as all the data and supporting files upon which each single result depends. Within the results tracker, each row corresponds to one result from the multi-result file. Information about each result includes type of result (figure or text), description, and supported claims. 

!!! note
    Each results tracker should be additionally listed and annotated as its own row in the resource tracker.

For detailed information on the name and defiition of each field in the results tracker, please refer to the [results tracker schema].
