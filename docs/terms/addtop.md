## Add-as-you-go annotation of study artefacts
This form of annotation involves tracking and annotating study data and non-data/supporting files as you move through the study. This type of annotation works best when paired with [wholistic annotation](holmin.md#wholistic-annotation-of-study-artefacts). Add-as-you-go annotation is built into the study process and so does not require dedicating a significant time at study end to retrospectively gather files and annotate. If you are fairly early in your study and have collected minimal or no data, ‘add-as-you-go’ annotation is recommended.

## Top-down annotation of study artefacts
This form of annotation involves tracking and annotating study data and non-data/supporting files at the end of your study, retrospectively. This type of annotation works best when paired with [minimal annotation](holmin.md#minimal-annotation-of-study-artefacts), however top-down annotation can also be [wholistic](holmin.md#wholistic-annotation-of-study-artefacts). The decision of wholistic vs. minimal annotation may be determined by the amount of time and resources your study has set aside for data sharing, as wholistic annotation would be more time consuming in a top-down orientation. If you are later in your study and have collected almost all or all of your data, ‘top-down’ annotation is recommended.
